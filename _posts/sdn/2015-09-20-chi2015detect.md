The paper proposed a "active probing" way to detecting forwarding anomalies and weighting anomalies.

The paper first classified the attacks into 4 types:

* **incorrect forwarding**: the forwarding destination may be incorrect, or duplicated.
* **duplicate forwarding**: the packets are forwarded to multiple ports.
* **packet manipulating**: the changes of the packet content.
* **weight adjusting**: changing the weight of each flow.

This paper introduces two algorithms that detect forwarding anomalies and weight adjusting anomalies. 
The two algorithms uses the same "active probing" idea.
The controller constructs special flow rules or "honey rules",
and send out packet that match the rules.
Correct forwarding should deliver the packets to correct destination.
The system verifies the forwarding results comparing to the intended results.

However the authors only proposed methods to detect incorrect forwarding and weight adjusting,
but not duplicate forwarding and packet manipulation.
