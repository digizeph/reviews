SPHINX is a anomaly detection application that sit in between the SDN controller and the SDN switches.
SPHINX aims to construct a trust-worthy topology graph, *flow graph*, using the controller's OpenFlow messages,
and detect anomalous messages from the SDN swithches using such graph.

## Theat Model

The OpenFlow messges from the controller to the switches are trustworthy.
But all the messages from the switches to the controller could be forged by a malicious switch or in some cases by the hosts.

## Flow Graph

The flow graph is constructed only using `FLOW_MOD` messages issued by the trusted controller.

The procedure is as the follows:

## SPHINX

With the flow graph built, the SPHINX raises alerts when it detects untrusted entities triggering *changes* to existing flow behavior,
or the flow violates any administrator-specified security policy.
