This paper introduces ASWatch,
a control-plane passive monitoring system that can identify malicious autonomous systems (ASes) with high accuracy.
The system learns features of ASes from the BGP updates and
defines normality using statistic features.

## Malicious and Legitimate ASes

The authors define the **malicious ASes** as those who are managed by cyber-criminals,
and with a main purpose of supporting illicit network activities.
The activities include but not limited as phishing, malware distribution, botnets, spamming etc.
The authors also define the term **malicious AS relation**, 
as the relationship between a malicious AS and its "masking ASes",
i.e. the providers of the malicious ASes.

The authors define the **legitiamte ASes** as those to provide legitimate Internet services.
Note that a legitimate AS could also be abused for malicious activities, 
but the authors consider those cases rare situations and not treat the ASes as malicious.

The main goal of this paper is to correctly identify the malicious ASes,
and separate them from the legitimate ASes.
The authors use the top 1,000 Alexa websites' ASes as a ground truth for legitimate ASes.

## Methodology

The system architecture is shown below.
ASWatch has a typical training and operating cycle of a monitoring system.

During the training duration,
ASWatch will use the ground truth knowledge and the existing relationship data 
to extract **labeled feature vectors** for a supervised statistical training.
The trained model will then be used to identify malicious ASes.

During the operational phase, the ASWatch takes in a sliding window of BGP snapshots,
and using the data to calculate the corresponding features vectors.
Through the comparison of the feature vectors with the learned model,
ASWatch can give out a **bad reputation score**.
A malicious AS is identified if the bad reputation score is higher than 90%
during the sliding window.

## Results

The detection false positive rate was kept around 5%, 
which the author argue was a pretty good result.

[![false positive][fp]][fp]

Here are some main results:

* accuracy ~93.3%
* three years' evaluation revealed 72% true positive
* around 50 to 60 days detection before the public media
* re-wiring features are the most important
    * re-wiring features represents the **instability frequency** of ASes
    * using only re-wiring features have around the same result
    * without re-wiring feature, the accuracy dropped dramatically
* the results are not sensitive to the parameter tuning

Compare to BGP Ranking, ASWatch achieves much better results.

## Conclusion

ASWatch serves as a **ranking system for ASes**,
uses **passive control-plane** monitoring data,
relies on **re-wiring features** to identify malicious ASes.
